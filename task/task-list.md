# PhantasyPhone Refactoring Task List

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the PhantasyPhone application to improve its architecture, maintainability, and scalability. The current codebase appears to be in a transitional state between a vanilla JavaScript implementation and a React-based implementation, with both approaches present.

## Refactoring Goals
- Standardize on a single technology stack (React)
- Improve code organization and structure
- Enhance maintainability and scalability
- Implement best practices for state management
- Improve asset management
- Enhance the developer experience

## Detailed Task List

### 1. Project Structure Cleanup
- [x] Create a task folder with this task list
- [ ] Remove legacy JavaScript files (js/ directory)
- [ ] Organize React components into logical folders
- [ ] Standardize file naming conventions
- [ ] Update import paths throughout the codebase

### 2. State Management Refactoring
- [ ] Refine the GameContext implementation
- [ ] Split context into smaller, more focused contexts if needed
- [ ] Implement proper loading and error states
- [ ] Add TypeScript interfaces for game state objects
- [ ] Improve script loading and parsing mechanism

### 3. Component Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Create reusable UI components for common elements
  - [ ] Message bubbles
  - [ ] Avatar components
  - [ ] App icons
  - [ ] Notification badges
- [ ] Implement proper prop validation
- [ ] Add component documentation
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling approach

### 4. Routing and Navigation Enhancements
- [ ] Refine React Router implementation
- [ ] Add route guards for screens that require certain conditions
- [ ] Implement proper loading states during navigation
- [ ] Add transition animations between screens

### 5. Asset Management
- [ ] Organize assets into appropriate folders (images, wallpapers, avatars)
- [ ] Implement proper asset preloading
- [ ] Add fallbacks for missing assets
- [ ] Optimize assets for performance

### 6. Script System Improvements
- [ ] Enhance script parser for better error handling
- [ ] Add validation for script format
- [ ] Implement a more robust command system
- [ ] Create a script editor/preview tool for development

### 7. UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Implement consistent styling using CSS variables or a styling library
- [ ] Improve responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Enhance visual feedback for user interactions

### 8. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Add component tests for key UI elements
- [ ] Implement integration tests for game flow
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

### 9. Build and Deployment Optimization
- [ ] Configure proper build process with Vite
- [ ] Implement code splitting for better performance
- [ ] Add environment configuration for different deployment targets
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/deployment

### 10. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with comprehensive project information
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create developer guides for adding new features
- [ ] Document the script format and commands

## Implementation Approach
The refactoring should be done incrementally, focusing on one area at a time to ensure the application remains functional throughout the process. Each task should include:

1. Analysis of current implementation
2. Design of improved solution
3. Implementation of changes
4. Testing to ensure functionality is preserved
5. Documentation of changes

## Priority Order
1. Project Structure Cleanup
2. State Management Refactoring
3. Component Architecture Improvements
4. Routing and Navigation Enhancements
5. Script System Improvements
6. Asset Management
7. UI/UX Enhancements
8. Testing Infrastructure
9. Build and Deployment Optimization
10. Documentation

This order ensures that foundational improvements are made first, followed by enhancements that build upon those foundations.
