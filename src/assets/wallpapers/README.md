# Wallpapers Directory

This directory will contain wallpaper images for the game.

In a production version, you would add actual image files here:
- default.jpg - The default wallpaper
- schedule.jpg - Unlocked after receiving the schedule from Alex
- benefits.jpg - Unlocked after receiving the benefits document from Taylor

For development purposes, the game will function without these files, but in a real implementation, you would need to add actual image files.
