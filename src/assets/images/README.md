# Images Directory

This directory will contain various images used in the game.

In a production version, you would add actual image files here:
- Character avatars:
  - alex-avatar.jpg
  - taylor-avatar.jpg
  - default-avatar.jpg (for the player)

- Message images:
  - schedule.jpg
  - benefits.jpg

For development purposes, the game will function without these files, but in a real implementation, you would need to add actual image files.
